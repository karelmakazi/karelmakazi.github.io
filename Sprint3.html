                            <h3>HTML vs CSS</h3>
                            <p>HTML would be the ingredient list of a recipe, while CSS would be the 
                                instructions telling you how to prepare and combine the ingredients to get a delicious meal.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Everyday Control Flow & Loops</h3>
                            <p>Control Flow and Loops are very similar to driving up to, into and around, and exiting a roundabout. When you get to the roundabout (control flow and loop block) you need to 
                                perform certain tasks to enter it. Once these tasks are completed and you find yourself inside the roundabout, you engage a certain set of behaviours such as checking for 
                                side traffic, using your indicator correctly and keeping an eye out for your exit. These In-Roundabout-Tasks are similar to tasks performed in a loop in the sense that you 
                                will need to keep doing them until the exit criteria is met. Once you reach your exit you can resume Regular-Driving-Mode and can proceed in the new direction.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The DOM</h3>
                            <p>The DOM, or Document Object Model is the framework in which all elements on a document are arranged. These elements are organised hierarchically and can be accessed directly by 
                                using their ‘address’ within the framework. Accessing an element in this way allows you to change its properties and behaviours in a number of ways. As an example - a page I am 
                                working on has a number of squares (theNephews) nested inside an element (littleBrother), nested inside another element (bigBrother). I am tasked with changing the colour of theNephews. 
                                To achieve this I would use a code editor or my browser developer tools and the nested address of the squares (bigBrother.litteBrother.theNephews) to access them directly. Once I have 
                                done this I can temporarily change their colour using the DevTools, and once I am satisfied with the result, write a CSS class to replicate what I did in the DevTools and assign that 
                                class to the Nephew elements on the fly.</p>
                            <h3>Array vs Object: Accessing Data</h3>
                            <p>The difference between accessing data in an array and in an object stems from the way that the data is stored within each of these variables. When new information is sent to an array it 
                                is assigned a numerical value based on the order in which it is added. ‘A’ would get assigned an index of 0, ‘B’ of 1 and so on. When you need to access information within an array you 
                                call it using this assigned numerical reference. When data is stored inside an object it is done as part of a Key:Value pair. This Key is created by yourself during the creation of the 
                                object or when it is specified as new data gets added. When you need to call (or store) data contained in the object you can then do so by referencing the Key directly.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Functions: What are they and why are the awesome?</h3>
                            <p>A function is a reusable block of code consisting of a name, parameters and a series of statements. When you call a function you pass it values matching the specified parameter. 
                                These values are then used by the statements and a value is returned to the function call. Functions are extremely efficient in that they only need to be written once and can then be 
                                used throughout your document, saving code redundancy and maintaining clarity in your work. Due to their flexible nature it is also entirely possible to reuse a function across multiple documents.
                            </p>

                            <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                            <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to be aware of your emotions and internal landscape at all times. You can then use this knowledge to interact with people and your surroundings in a way that is based on the 
                                facts at hand, rather than on your reactions to the facts. </p>
                            <h3>How is this different from IQ?</h3>
                            <p>IQ is merely a way of measuring intelligence based on a set of standard questions, often based on information and skills acquired during academic pursuits. EQ on the other hand is based on how you handle the 
                                intersection of your internal world with the external. This makes EQ more of a skill than a baseline measurement and while it requires effort to do so, the constant flux in which we find ourselves provides 
                                ample opportunity for growth and development of the skills that make up our EQ.</p>
                            <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
                            <p>EQ is important because it sits right on the border where our internal world brushes up against the external. As such it can act as a filter through which all sense perceptions flow in and all actions and 
                                flow back out again. Having the skills to self moderate in this way enables you to act on each situation in an authentic way - thereby increasing the effectiveness and suitability of your actions.
