                            <h3>Personal Values</h3>
                            <p>My personal values can be summed up as constantly striving to embody the stoic virtues of fairness, kindness, courage, honesty and self-discipline.</p>

                            <h3>Making Ethical Decisions: Values & Consequences</h3>
                            <p>In my precious occupation I was employed by a large multinational corporation. During the course of my time there the general focus of 
                                the business shifted due to parent company management changes and as part of this shift found myself creating advertisements encouraging 
                                people into debt for items they most certainly did not need. I had some ethical concerns with this, and after some careful consideration 
                                decided to step away from the role. As a consequence of acting with authenticity and honour my departure went smoothly (which was not the case 
                                in several other such moves from within my team and here I am at Dev Academy</p>

                            <h3>Cultural Influences: Values & Identity</h3>
                            <p>I was raised in a very conservative, rural Afrikaner household. Unfortunately most of the stereotypes youâ€™d come to associate with that is true
                                 and I grew up mired in inequality and racism, all backed up by what I believed to be Christian values. On arriving in New Zealand I realised 
                                 just how much of an echo chamber I grew up in and my ideas began to rapidly evolve into something that I could feel proud about, rather than 
                                 just being what is described to be by my culture & peers. This was further bolstered when I attended university and gained the ability to question 
                                 beliefs in every form it might take. Pushing me away from, and then fostering a deep dislike of disingenuous beliefs - and the methods used to promote 
                                 them. I can proudly say that my beliefs are based on carefully considered moral values, and that my passion for constantly refining these ideas is given 
                                 momentum by having spent time in the darkness myself.</p>

                            <h3>Who I Am: Strengths</h3>
                            <p>Based off my INFJ-T Meyers-Briggs results I feel that the following Strengths would serve me well in both learning and career development. 
                                Creativity helps me solve problems in elegant ways and add beauty to the world. Being passionate and determined provides fuel for both the 
                                learning process and for getting things done in the most efficient way possible. When I am comfortable with a group of people I am also quite 
                                good at keeping morale up and in helping everyone get over the line with what is expected of us as a team.</p>

                            <h3>Who I Am: Limitations</h3>
                            <p>More problematic aspects of my personality would be that I can be very sensitive to criticism and that I tend to take it rather personally. 
                                This is something I am very aware of and I am constantly working on overcoming this issue. As a possible outflow of this sensitivity I also tend 
                                to be very private - this generally falls away to a certain extent once I am comfortable with the people around me but in a space dominated by extroverts 
                                this comfort takes a long time to achieve. A further issue that stands as the shadow side of Determination and Passion is that I can burn out easily as 
                                self sacrifice for the greater good is an incredibly normal way for me to behave. </p>

                            <h3>Who I Am: The Hybrids</h3>
                            <p>There are also a group of traits that could be both negative and positive, depending on how much wisdom I employ in such situations. I tend to be quite altruistic 
                                which can lead to me being taken advantage of or self sacrificing for the greater good. This does make me a pretty good person to have on team though, as I love 
                                helping wherever I can. In certain circumstances I can be pretty decisive and need to remain aware that while it can lead to getting things done, I also need to be 
                                open to changing the direction as the situation dictates. Perfectionism is also a two edged sword in that it can result in work of high quality, but left unchecked 
                                can make me a slow worker. Possibly the hardest trait to deal with is that I tend to need a cause to make my work meaningful, because without meaning I have no purpose 
                                and can become a bit unhappy about life in general.</p>

                            <h3>Strengths and Values that can help me along the way</h3>
                            <p>Passion and Curiosity: I am very curious and love nothing more than to dive into some subject that I am interested in and then to soak up as much of it as I can. 
                                This process is given extra momentum if I am passionate about the subject matter, as the added meaning this gives the learning process makes it easy to intuitively 
                                follow the information trail and incorporate relevant information into my frame of understanding. I believe that these two traits will serve me well when I hit an 
                                obstacle as my passion will provide the grit to keep going in the face of adversity while curiosity chips away at the edges with possible solutions.</p>

                            <h3>Dealing with Conflicts</h3>
                            <p>In my previous career there was often intense disagreement and resistance from other areas of the company. I realised that much of this stemmed from the caustic corporate 
                                culture, the pressure and the kind of personalities that were drawn to the positions I had to interact with. I found that the best way to handle difficult situations was 
                                to step away from them in a polite but firm manner in order to create some distance between the issue and the emotions bouncing around and then revisiting them with a kind 
                                and open heart once everything had settled down again. While I am asked to come up with other strategies I could use, I firmly believe that given the situation this is the 
                                best one available to me and I will continue to use it in ways tailored to suit each interaction.</p>
