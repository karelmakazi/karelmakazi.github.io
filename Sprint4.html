                            <h3> A Wild Blockage Appears</h3>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Problem:</span> 
                                I had to write some code that would go through a list of numbers and return either Fizz, Bang or FizzBang 
                                depending on if the number was divisible by 5 or 3. While I had a fairly clear understanding of the logic 
                                and steps involved in solving this, I stumbled on the numbers that were divisible by both 3 and 5. 
                                Eventually I discovered that I had my step order the wrong way around and managed to solve the problem with a quick cut and paste!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Techniques Used:</span> 
                                Rubber Ducky, Pseudocode, Trying something, trying something again, and again. Googling and finally 
                                good old console.logging to keep track of what was going on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">During the Process:</span> 
                                Initially I was quite confident that I could easily solve the problem and when I ran up against issues I 
                                searched for wrong problems. This lead to a bit of frustration and I got fairly bogged down. Luckily I trusted 
                                my gut at one stage and tried the order swap and it worked!
                            </p>
                            <p>

                               Mistakes can crop up in various stages of the process, and even if I feel fairly confident in how it all comes 
                               ogether I should still check out all avenues instead of leaving blind spots because I think what I did there was correct.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Take the Wins</h3>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Problem:</span> 
                                I was asked to write code to automate a gradebook for students. While I do not think myself qualified in even the 
                                aguest sense to be calling my work elegant, I managed to get a good grasp of what was required and what steps to 
                                follow to achieve my goals. My pseudocode worked well and I was able to finish up the task without too many issues - 
                                which was a very exciting and hugely encouraging.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Techniques Used:</span> 
                                Rubber Ducky, PseudoCode, Trying Something and Google.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">During the Process:</span> 
                                During the process I felt quite calm, not sure of myself at all, but certain enough that the answer was 
                                just around the corner to get into the focus zone and put it all together efficiently.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Lessons Learnt:</span> 
                                Not a technical or problem solving skill, but rather than I can do this and that coding can be as much 
                                fun as I had hoped it would be! 
                            </p>
                            <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">PseudoCode:</span>  
                                I enjoy using pseudocode and have tried to make it the second step in all the problems I have to solve. 
                                That being said there is a lot of room for improvement in the way I plan and lay the pseudocode out. 

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Try Something:</span> 
                                I do this a lot, but I don’t find it as effective at this stage. Almost as if it is a bit of a dice roll 
                                considering my low level of coding skills, but sometimes that quick attempt yields some pretty pleasing results!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Rubber Ducky:</span>
                                My go-to first step, I feel that the process of pulling apart a problem during the story telling phase of 
                                RubberDucky gives a good understanding of what needs to be done before the brain kicks in with recons and plans. 
                                This understanding works really well with pseudocode as I can use them together to stop myself from going down 
                                rabbit holes which might not even yield the results I was hoping for.
 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Error Messages:</span>
                                I feel I make good use of error messages. Or at least I try to, as they can be pretty inscrutable at times 
                                still. I am however very confident that my skills in reading them and using the information to quickly hone 
                                in on an issue will only grow experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Console.log:</span>
                                Another technique I use all the time. Not entirely sure if it is good practice to do so but I am constantly 
                                checking the results of functions or logging out alerts when my code reaches certain spots. To me it feels 
                                like a very valuable window into what my code is doing, or let’s be honest - what it ISN’T doing.
 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Google:</span> 
                                Where would I be without googling - when I started this course I was blown away by how granular you can 
                                get with your search terms and still get solid results. There is truth to the statement that every problem 
                                you have, someone else already had and probably solved. The hardest part would be sifting through them all 
                                to find the applicable solutions - but this is also a skill I expect will develop as I gain experience.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Peer Assistance:</span> 
                                A bit of a gap in my arsenal here as I have not had to do this yet. There is just so much help available 
                                online that I have not had to resort to asking my peers for help. I suspect that this will change once we 
                                hit bootcamp and are all together.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Coach Assistance:</span>
                                I have not had to do this yet either - but feel that I would be pretty confident in asking assistance or 
                                clarification if I need to do so.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Improving through Reflection:</span> 
                                This is a pretty vital step to learning and almost takes place despite what I’m doing. 
                                I often find myself thinking of different ways of tackling a coding task while cooking 
                                or just running through a problem in my head while driving. I feel that this mulling 
                                over helps me incorporate new skills into my matrix of meaning.

                            <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
                            <p>
                                Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity brings two main benefits. The first benefit aligns 
                                extremely closely with that of the Growth Mindset, in that it opens that mental door inside a person 
                                that leads to development through all stages of life. The second, and more practical benefit it that 
                                by understanding how neuroplasticity works, is that once a person becomes familiar with how it takes 
                                place and what kind of actions and behaviours encourage neuroplasticity, they can actively seek out, 
                                and embrace such situations and behaviours to harness this incredible ability for their own continued 
                                improvement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Principles of neuroplasticity which may be extremely useful in a learning environment is knowing that 
                                there are two distinct stages of learning (short term and long term) and that each of these stages have 
                                techniques you can use improve performance. Short term learning can be encouraged through the use of 
                                novelty and by applying short bursts  of fully focussed engagement. The second phase of neuroplastic 
                                development involves the physical growth and development of brain structures and as such thrives on 
                                repeated practice over a time, and from the continued integration of new knowledge into a cohesive 
                                contextual model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The following methods are some of the ways by which you can increase the effectiveness of neuroplasticity:
                                Intermittent Fasting offers a range of cognitive benefits such as the promotion of neuron growth and 
                                synaptic adaptation. Learning a new skill, such as juggling or playing an instrument triggers activity 
                                across a number of brain areas and in so doing enhances their interconnectivity which in turn can lead 
                                to the formation of new neural networks. Non-dominant hand exercises encourages the growth of entirely 
                                new neural pathways, and strengthens the connections between neurons. Sleeping well aids in the retention 
                                of what you have learnt as it encourages the growth of new connections between neurons, and thereby 
                                increasing the transfer of information.
                            </p>

                            <h3>The Growth Mindset</h3>
                            <p>
                                Growth mindset is the faith you have in your own ability to grow and develop. This is hugely important as it forms 
                                he motivational backbone for virtually all human development. Having a growth mindset is also extremely relevant in 
                                our current situation as there would be no purpose in even trying to learn something new if you didn’t believe that 
                                you had the ability to do so.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This belief isn’t a simple on/off switch though and by integrating the principles of a growth mindset in a mindful 
                                way you are able to find areas where you might be holding yourself back due to a lack of self confidence, or to give 
                                you that final morale boost to keep cracking away at problem which seems unsolvable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was this last realisation that I found most surprising during my research and I will be focusing a lot of effort 
                                during my learning journey towards finding such self limiting beliefs in myself and swapping them out for more complete 
                                and resilient growth mindset versions.
