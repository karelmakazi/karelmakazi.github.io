                            <p>In this post I will first briefly dicsuss the differences between Class and ID and then outline some of the best practices you should
                            consider when using these two identifiers in your work.</p>

                            <h3>What is an Identifier?</h3>
                            <p>Both Class and ID can be considered an identifier. You can use them when you need to refer to a specific element within your hmtl code 
                            from within your CSS file. But what is the difference bewteen them, and when should I use ID as opposed to class? </p>

                            <h3>All part of the Team</h3>
                            <p>The most important destinction between ID and Class is that of scope. ID is very specific and there can only ever be one instance of
                            a particular ID in your code. Class is much more flexible and can be applied to many different elements within the same page, and an element
                            can even have mulitple classes applied to it. A real life analogy can be found in the murky world of sportsball. If we think about a stock
                            standard team of sportsballers, the position a player plays in will be its ID. There may be lots of players running around, but there can only
                            ever be one Boss Ballstopper per team. Class would be more akin to the Team in the sense that all members are part of the same entity and that
                            they all wear the team jersey regardless of where they play. This analogy can also be extended further as any element on a page can have 
                            more than one class assigned to it - just as a sportsballer can play different kinds of sport while still being a member of the team.</p>

                            <h3>Best Practices</h3> 
                            <p>In most cases it would be preferable to use Class rather than ID. This is mainly due to the incredible flexibility of a class. You can set them 
                            up once and then apply them across your entire site, fine tuning and applying multiple levels of classes to get your job done quickly and 
                            effectively across all elements sharing the assigned class.</p>

                            <p>IDs trade their flexibility in order to be referenced directly. This specificity allows you to fine tune your elements to very fine degree but 
                            only ever the one element that bears that ID. IDs also outrank classes, and can be used to overwrite any styling stemming from a class. 
                            In short, due to being unique IDs excel at being called and referred to by workflow elements such as direct styling, anchor links and is 
                            particulary handy in Javascript.</p>

                            <p>To summarise - when you need to apply styling across a range of elements without creating referential chaos, use Class. When it comes to 
                            styling one very particular element and that element only, or if you need to refer or call an object directly, use ID.</p>

                            <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                            <p>My long term goal in attending EDA is to make the leap from Graphic Design into a more tech based career. In the long run I would ideally like 
                                to add some additional languages into my coding arsenal and potentially move away from design based work and into more abstract coding. 
                                The end goal in all of this however would be to find a spot in an industry where I can have control over how and when I work and where I can 
                                manage my day in a way that allows time to look after myself and my mental health.</p>
                            <h3>Soft Skills To Be Acquired</h3>
                            <p>I feel that I am pretty good with people. I do have a limit though and once that has been crossed I find it very hard to be around and deal 
                                with people and life in general. In my past career I was pulled over that line more than I’d like to admit and would love if my time at EDA 
                                can go some way towards resetting my position in this regard. I am also hoping that having more agency would allow me to grow an industry 
                                suitable resilience that I can maintain in the long run.</p>
                            <h3>Strenghts & Weaknesses</h3>
                            <p>Strengths: I am determined, curious to a fault, love to learn and I love helping people <br>Weaknesses: I am perfectionistic, can get focussed on 
                               details and can lose interest quickly if I can’t see any purpose in what I’m doing.</p>
                            <h3>How I could Grow</h3>
                            <p>With all of the above I believe that the best way for me to grow would be to firstly have control over my day. This will enable me to build a routine 
                                designed to keep anxiety at bay and allow me to work with a clear, calm and efficient mind when I do sit down to do my work. I realise that this might 
                                become a bit of an issue when Boot Camp kicks off but I am hoping that the groundwork I’m doing now will give me the tools to cope with the sudden increase 
                                in workload and stress at that time.</p>
                            <h3>What To Do When Stuck</h3>
                            <p>I must admit that I have a bit of a hard time asking for help, but have discovered the joys of Googling my coding problems and quickly finding solutions, 
                                and if not solutions, then good pointers towards further research. If this fails me I will make use of the Slack channels. I suspect that as I become more 
                                familiar with my cohort (and the code advice channel people) the balance between these options will shift.</p>
                            <h3>Faciliting Facilitors</h3>
                            <p>I expect my facilitation team to have some understanding of possible danger areas for me (mental health traps) and possibly help me a little when I do hit a 
                                slump. Other than that, just being there to check in and give expert pointers and support when needed would be more than anyone could hope for! </p>
                            <h3>Other Commitments</h3>
                            <p>I have no set in stone time commitments I need to work around at the moment.</p>
