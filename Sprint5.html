                            <h3> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                            <p>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">One:</span> 
                                I get hyper focussed on details easily.<br>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Two:</span> 
                                I love to learn new things.<br>
                                <span class="innerSubHeads">Three:</span>
                                I can be pretty stubborn.<br>

                            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Values underpin everything you do, and as such ensuring that your own values are consistent with a life of learning and growth would be vital to making a success of any new endeavour. Applying both empathy and self awareness when dealing with another person ensures that the interaction is efficient as it keeps the interaction on an even keel, and because all participants are valued throughout, ideas and thought flow freely resulting in a better outcome for everyone involved.
                            </p>
                            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                            <p>
                                I found the neuroplasticity information quite interesting and have made us of their suggestions and am currently teaching myself some touch typing in the hopes that it would further enhance my learning across the entire spectrum of what I need to learn. 
                            </p>

                            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>
                            <p>
                                Sharing things that I would normally consider to be quite private.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                            <p>
                                I can see the value in teaching the core skills to your students as it will give us an advantage when it comes to joining new teams at the end of course. Wholesome interpersonal interactions will also enable us to be better programmers due to the benefits of higher level communication in the workplace.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                            <p>
                                I fully understand the necessity of the core content and the role it will play in me becoming a successful programmer, and as such the time spent on core content wasnâ€™t a wasted effort.
                            </p>

                            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                            <p>
                                I aim to get a foot in the coding door, gain industry experience and eventually seek out a position that supports working remotely. In addition I also aim to learn some additional languages to aid in this - Python is of particular interest.
                            </p>
                            <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Biggest strength and weakness lives in the same house. I am good with people and work well in a team, but I can find this extremely draining which then goes on to impact other aspects of my life.
                            </p>
                            <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Making sure that I remain in a good headspace despite the stress and workload.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Quick and effective pair problem solving skills would be a pretty good skill to sharpen up.
                            </p>

                            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp.</h3>
                            <p>
                                I am happy to see that there are plenty of opportunities to talk to the staff at EDA and fully intend on making that my first point of contact if I need any help. As I do not yet know what it will be like I cannot make any a commitment other than that I will do my best to get through it - ready to enter the workforce quickly.
                            </p>
