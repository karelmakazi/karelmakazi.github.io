                            <p>My name is Karel Fourie and I currently reside in West Auckland. I am quite into philosophy and tend to think about values a lot. 
                                If I can highlight two values that I consider vital to me and the way I do things it would be humility regarding what I know, and 
                                the constant striving towards improvement. There will always be people who can teach me how to do something better, or how to BE a 
                                better person myself, and the willingness to accept and continuously implement the new skills and wisdom, even in the face of adversity, 
                                is very important to me. 
                            <p>I am attending EDA because it offers me a golden opportunity to change over to an industry where I can feel 
                                intellectually stimulated, where I can indulge my love of learning and ultimately give me more flexibility in how, where and when I work. 
                                I look forward to undertaking this journey with you all!</p>
