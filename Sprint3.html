                            <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                            <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to be aware of your emotions and internal landscape at all times. You can then use this knowledge to interact with people and your surroundings in a way that is based on the 
                                facts at hand, rather than on your reactions to the facts. </p>
                            <h3>How is this different from IQ?</h3>
                            <p>IQ is merely a way of measuring intelligence based on a set of standard questions, often based on information and skills acquired during academic pursuits. EQ on the other hand is based on how you handle the 
                                intersection of your internal world with the external. This makes EQ more of a skill than a baseline measurement and while it requires effort to do so, the constant flux in which we find ourselves provides 
                                ample opportunity for growth and development of the skills that make up our EQ.</p>
                            <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
                            <p>EQ is important because it sits right on the border where our internal world brushes up against the external. As such it can act as a filter through which all sense perceptions flow in and all actions and 
                                flow back out again. Having the skills to self moderate in this way enables you to act on each situation in an authentic way - thereby increasing the effectiveness and suitability of your actions.
